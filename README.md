# Mystic

An API that scrapes data for Magic the Gathering content and returns it in json form. Our goal is to support content creators big and small, and to provide a resource that other MTG fans can use to create awesome stuff. We collect URL links, author names, images, and other relevant information from articles, videos, and podcasts.

The API also returns random mtg art for when content does not return a thumbnail image, and other data from Scryfall such as their currently featured set.

## How to use it

Mystic can be accessed at `https://mystic-api-test.herokuapp.com/articles` for articles

and `https://mystic-api-test.herokuapp.com/videos` for videos and podcasts.

Content is returned in json form. Sample data is below:
